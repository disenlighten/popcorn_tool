# Calculate rolling per-hour averages for Popcorn Sales

I worked with [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) to write this project as a learning tool. 
The program will allow you to input a location name and popcorn types, will calculate and re-calculate per hour-averages, and then save
in a .json file when you're ready to quit. 

Additionally, with a python script you can read in the .json file and see a visualization of the data per location over time.


## Prerequisites
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) 2021

(For plotting sales per location)
pandas
matplotlib
